#For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
#I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
#Lastly, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

#Creating a table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data.csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#I wanted to determine the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track. 
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity)
,avg(danceability)
,avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#I wanted to determine the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

#I wanted to categorize the length of each song by duration type (long, standard, short)
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms AS 'Duration (ms)',
    CASE
    WHEN duration_ms between 180000 and 240000 THEN 'Standard'
    WHEN duration_ms >240000 THEN 'Long'
    ELSE 'Short'
    END AS 'Duration Type'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#I am curious of the average popularity score for Olivia Rodrigo's songs and the score for each song
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity, AVG(popularity) 
OVER (PARTITION BY artist_name) as 'Average popularity'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
ORDER BY popularity desc;

#I wanted to count how many songs each artist has that made to the top 50 in 2021
SELECT artist_name, count(track_name) as 'number of tracks'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(track_name) desc;
